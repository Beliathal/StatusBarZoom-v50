	Density-independent pixels

	Density-independent pixels, written as dp (pronounced "dips"), are flexible units that scale to have uniform dimensions 
	on any screen. They provide a flexible way to accommodate a design across platforms.
	
	****

	Scalable pixels (sp)

	Scalable pixels (sp) serve the same function as density-independent pixels (dp), but for fonts. The default value of an 
	sp is the same as the default value for a dp.

	The primary difference between an sp and a dp is that sp's preserve a user's font settings. Users who have larger text 
	settings for accessibility will see font sizes match their text size preferences.
